        Week2:Software engineering
        <p>This week was about diving deeper  HTML and CSS, I built my first semblace of a full web page- with plenty of errors!I learned that styling isn't easy, but to give context its like painting a house-HTML lays the foundation , and css adds color. We also explored Git,GitHub, cloud services, Bootstrap which was intimidating at first.And let's say I took my time getting familiar with(I kept it unzipped on my PC for two days before using it!) While I'm not a pro yet ,I used it to create this layout , which is progress in itself:Reminding myself:progress over perfection!styling may be challenging but I'll get there.</p>   
      Week 2:Leadership & Personal Development
      <p>We said goodbye  to our now technical model in week two by completing the seven habits .We got to  expand on the content of week 1 by doing habits 4 , 5 and 7.This was my best week.My biggest take away from this sadly brief module is that life isn't  a destination but a journey.With that my two week whirlwind came to an end .Looking forward to new modules and of course Javascript!</p>
