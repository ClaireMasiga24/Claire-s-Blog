    Week 1:Software engineering
    <p>This was the beignning of a module I was particurlarly keen on having.Much to my surprise, the  first days were quite overwhelming.It wasn't the instructor,  it was just my intent on being perfect and getting it right instantly.Theory classes which were our first lessons just increased my underlying feelings that I was a fraud.That I didn't belong here.In retrospect I wonder why cause we basically learnt about the internet,secure & insecure websites.No rocket Science!yet nevertheless I felt overwhelmed. Then we drove into HTML and CSS ,and something clicked .I finally felt like I was capable of doing something.It was a small win ,but it gave me hope.Trust me ,there's nothing more fullfilling than your first "Hello World" printed on a browser.Most exciting of it all was the fact that I got to actually understand how software engineering happens in industry which was one of my goals starting the course.</p>
    Week 1:Leadership & Personal Development
    <p>This was our first non technical model of the entire engineering course.We were introduced to the seven habits of highly effective people by Stephen Covey.Initially I didnt expect the non technical  modules to be challenging .I am more of a hands on person, but as we  started exploring the three habits and concepts like the Maturity continuum and listening to be understood .I was challenged because many of my assumptions on leadership and growing up especially as a young adult were put to test,overrall, I found this experience to be beautiful and a way to add nuance my technical modules.</p>

  Week2:Software engineering
  <p>This week was about diving deeper  HTML and CSS, I built my first semblace of a full web page- with plenty of errors!I learned that styling isn't easy, but to give context its like painting a house-HTML lays the foundation , and css adds color. We also explored Git,GitHub, cloud services, Bootstrap which was intimidating at first.And let's say I took my time getting familiar with(I kept it unzipped on my PC for two days before using it!) While I'm not a pro yet ,I used it to create this layout , which is progress in itself:Reminding myself:progress over perfection!styling may be challenging but I'll get there.</p>   
Week 2:Leadership & Personal Development
<p>We said goodbye to our now technical model in week two by completing the seven habits .We got to  expand on the content of week 1 by doing habits 4 , 5 and 7.This was my best week.My biggest take away from this sadly brief module is that life isn't  a destination but a journey.With that my two week whirlwind came to an end .Looking forward to new modules and of course Javascript!</p>
